**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun.

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)
        - Proposal categories

        - Delegation
    - Treasury management
    - Going further

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)
        - Proposal categories

        - Delegation
    - Treasury management
    - Going further

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)
        - Proposal categories

        - Delegation
    - Treasury management
    - Going further

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
    - DAO Infrastructure
    - Ghosts Improvement Proposal (GIP)
        - Proposal categories

        - Delegation
    - Treasury management
    - Going further

**Category :** Core : Process & Infrastructure

**Kudos:** Ghosts#0000, MrMisang#2807

**Abstract**

GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, for more fun. For the sustainability of the GhostProject DAO, it requires standardized processes and guidelines. This proposal suggests the vision, infrastructure, and process of the GhostProject DAO to make the community aligned and move forward.

**Discourse** : https://forum.ghostsproject.com/t/gip-1-initiating-ghostsproject-dao/32

**Rationale**  

- Besides the roadmap planned by the Ghostsproject founding team (MrMisang and OFF), the GhostsProject community is creating an amazing impact on the space through the contribution of the members (Art & derivatives, sub-community, IRL event, Merch, etc…)
- However, process and decision-making channels supporting various community activities are centralized or independently executed
- Through initiating GhostProject DAO, various initiatives can be decided by the community and be financially and socially supported
- For the sustainability of the DAO, below suggests the vision and standardized process:
    - GhostsProject DAO supports Ghosts in creating various art and culture while making it used more often, by more people, and for more fun
